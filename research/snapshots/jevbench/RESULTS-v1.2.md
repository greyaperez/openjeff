## Honorable mentions — services built on another entrant's model

A service that runs another entrant's model is listed with all of its scores and axes, but is not ranked against the models. Ranking it would rank the same model twice, once at the model's own price and once at the service's. The row keeps every number, axis, cost basis and per-task outcome; it carries no rank number.

| # | System | **JevBench Score** | Intelligence | Calibration | Speed | Cost | $ per 1,000 decisions | p50 raw → adjusted | Endpoint |

|  | classifier.dev (fast tier) | **83.6** | 85.1 | 77.9 | 87.6 | 84.3 | $0.0033 est. | 0.39 s | production API (classifier.dev, fast tier) |

### classifier.dev (fast tier) — runs on Jev (TypeSafe)

classifier.dev is not its own model. Its own pages say so: "The fast tier is Jev, TypeSafe's decision model" (https://classifier.dev/benchmark, read 2026-09-20), and the API answers with "model": "jev-1.13.0" — the same model version this benchmark measures directly as Jev 1.13.0. What it adds is a price and, on its smart tier, an orchestration layer: "The smart tier is Jev plus a reasoning model re-asking only the answers Jev put under 0.7 confidence" — escalation on low confidence (a model cascade), not best-of-N, not self-consistency and not a committee. Its published escalation model is gemini-3.8-flash. Ranking it against Jev would rank Jev's model against Jev's model, so from v1.2.4 it is an honorable mention instead of #1.

**Only the fast tier was measured. The smart tier's escalation was never run, so nothing here scores it.**

*Price.* $0.0033 per 1,000 decisions is an estimate from the published flat-rate plan at full use: classifier.dev Pro is $20/month for 200,000 fast classifications a day (https://classifier.dev/pricing, read 2026-09-20), and one classification is one decision. Lower use costs more per decision — at a tenth of that allowance it is $0.033 per 1,000 — and the free tier (20,000 fast classifications a day), which is what our run used, costs nothing. Their pages do not say how the flat rate is funded, so we do not know their cost basis; the only figure they publish is what the model costs a caller: "The model behind the fast tier costs about $0.005 per thousand classifications and needs a TypeSafe key" (https://classifier.dev/pricing) — for their short single-sentence inputs, not for JevBench's whole questions.

*Not a pass-through.* On our set the fast tier scored 97.3 % on the judge tier against Jev's 94.5 %, and 70.5 % against 74.1 % on the hard tier. classifier.dev's own explanation for differences of this kind is batching ("The fast tier is Jev, packed a thousand to a request"); on their own two test sets they measured the same difference as noise.

Footnote — BAAI bge-reranker-v2-m3: Neutral documented reranker adapter; instruction and no-instruction public calibration were run, then frozen before one held-out pass.

Footnote — Certo v1 (AltSlate Labs): The public Certo v1 checkpoint through the author's DecisionModel, serially on our rented GPU. The question instruction is prepended to the state because Certo exposes state + runtime options but no separate question field; the published 64-token state and 48-token option limits are unchanged. The model card says v1 does not yet transfer to arbitrary natural-language prose. Cost is an estimate from same-size hosted encoders times the checkpoint's retained input tokens, not free/100.

Footnote — classifier.dev (fast tier): Its own benchmark page says the fast tier is Jev. Free for us; the price is its published Pro plan ($20/month for 200,000 fast classifications a day) at full use, $0.0033 per 1,000 decisions.

Footnote — decider-2b (Mapika): The author's TypeSafe-compatible server and published weights (Qwen3.5-2B-Base with a trained one-pass decision readout), run serially on our GPU. Self-host latency gets the standard ×2 + 0.15 s adjustment.

Footnote — decider-35b-a3b (Mapika): The author's TypeSafe-compatible server and published FP8 weights, run serially on our H100 NVL. The exhaustive startup batch warmup was skipped; each required serial shape captured lazily before its measured request. Self-host latency receives the standard ×2 + 0.15 s adjustment. Cost uses the closest hosted 35B-A3B input tariff and is not the temporary rental charge.

Footnote — decision-machine-1 (milliseconds.ai): A closed-weights decision model behind a production API that serves TypeSafe's wire format, so the unchanged typesafe adapter ran it. Run on a free test key (30 requests a minute, 2.2 s between requests); the provider states the inference infrastructure is the same as for paid keys. Cost is the public paid tariff, $0.04 per million input tokens (output free), times the input tokens the API reported.

Footnote — djev (thinking): Experimental full-generation path over the same DiffusionGemma checkpoint as djev-dev: thinking was enabled and the model could generate up to 8,192 tokens before returning its distribution. Current djev-dev itself hard-codes enable_thinking=false, diffusion_max_steps=1 and read_only=true, so this is not a switch in its published typed API. It is substantially slower/costlier, and 72/534 requests exhausted the output budget without a parseable distribution; those are failures. Cost uses measured tokens and a same-size hosted reference, not the H200 rental bill.

Footnote — djev (Maisa, diffusion-gemma): The measured endpoint was Maisa's hosted API in free preview; the cost uses its announced price ($0.035 per million input tokens, output free), and nothing was charged. The self-hostable djev-dev runtime is Apache-2.0 and applies a structured one-step inference method to Google's Apache-2.0 diffusiongemma-26B-A4B-it checkpoint; it adds no separately trained djev weights. Probabilities are djev's own (its docs call them experimental and uncalibrated).

Footnote — GLiNER2 large (Fastino): The large checkpoint of Fastino's earlier GLiNER2 family, same documented mapping as the GLiNER2 row: the question goes in front of the text and the probabilities are the model's own single-label softmax over the labels, read out in full. A general schema classifier, not a Jev rebuild.

Footnote — GLiNER2.5 multi (Fastino, 287M): The multilingual GLiNER2.5 checkpoint (287M), same family and same documented mapping as the GLiNER2 row. JevBench items are English only, so its multilingual training is not exercised here.

Footnote — GLiNER2.5 small (Fastino, 74M): The small GLiNER2.5 checkpoint (74M), same family and same documented mapping as the GLiNER2 row: the question goes in front of the text and the probabilities are the model's own single-label softmax over the labels, read out in full. A general schema classifier, not a Jev rebuild.

Footnote — GLiNER2 (gliner2.5-base): A general schema classifier, not a Jev rebuild. The question goes in front of the text; the probabilities are GLiNER2's own single-label softmax over the labels, read out in full (mapping fixed before the run).

Footnote — Alibaba GTE Reranker ModernBERT-base: Neutral documented reranker adapter; instruction and no-instruction public calibration were run, then frozen before one held-out pass.

Footnote — jeff (GLiFormer 400M): Self-hosted from its GitHub repo with server defaults, on our CPU (the author recommends a GPU, e.g. an L4), through the same TypeSafe-compatible API as Jev.

Footnote — jev-local (Qwen3.5-9B): The author's local Jev-compatible server in its default full configuration: a frozen Qwen3.5-9B scores each option by its mean log-probability (one forward pass per option, no generation, no decision training). Run serially on our GPU. It re-reads the state once per option; if its reported token count covers one pass only, a per-token hosted price would be higher than this estimate.

Footnote — jqv (Qwen3-32B zero-shot): A stock Qwen3-32B with no decision training: the state is prefilled once, each question is an isolated branch and the answer is read from the option-letter logits, with one fitted temperature (3.02, 400 MMLU validation items). Re-run in v1.2.8 on our own GPU from the now-public serving code (Octalab-Inc/jqv 0189b67), so all 534 decisions including the held-out hard items were asked; this full run replaces the v1.2.7 partial row, which had been measured on the submitter's machine. Cost is the base model's public per-token tariff, not free.

Footnote — kev 0.5B: Self-hosted from the author's repository at commit 20fa626 through its native TypeSafe-compatible `/v1/systemone` server, BF16 on an RTX 3090; measured serially from Sandy over the internet. This is the v0.1 release.

Footnote — kev 0.6B (research preview): Self-hosted from the author's repository at commit 20fa626 through its native TypeSafe-compatible `/v1/systemone` server, BF16 on an RTX 3090; measured serially from Sandy over the internet. The author labels this checkpoint a research preview.

Footnote — kev 4B (research preview): Self-hosted from the author's repository at commit 20fa626 through its native TypeSafe-compatible `/v1/systemone` server, BF16 on an RTX 3090; measured serially from Sandy over the internet. The author labels this checkpoint a research preview.

Footnote — kev 8B (research preview): Self-hosted from the author's repository at commit 20fa626 through its native TypeSafe-compatible `/v1/systemone` server, BF16 on an RTX 3090; measured serially from Sandy over the internet. The author labels this checkpoint a research preview.

Footnote — Laya (421M): The English checkpoint (repo root), run on our CPU through its own `laya` package. Its budget is 512 tokens per question, so long hard-tier states are cut by the package itself.

Footnote — LitJev (Qwen3.8-27B): The author's reproduction of Jev's decision layer on an off-the-shelf model, in its default configuration: Qwen3.8-27B, scores read from the output head, no training and no calibration file (its README says probabilities are not calibrated by default). Run serially on our GPU through an SSH tunnel, because its server binds to localhost; the request still crosses the internet and gets the ×2 + 0.15 s adjustment.

Footnote — Mixedbread mxbai-rerank-base-v2: Neutral documented reranker adapter; instruction and no-instruction public calibration were run, then frozen before one held-out pass.

Footnote — Bespoke Nimble 9B: Re-run in v1.2.8 at Bespoke Labs' request after they raised the serving prompt limit from 2,048 to 8,192 tokens (bespokelabsai/nimble PR #4). Same recipe as the v1.1.3 run — the published LoRA merged into Qwen3.5-9B with the author's PEFT safe-merge, served with SGLang and the author's Jev-compatible API — now from current nimble main; the adapter weights are unchanged. Hard-tier accuracy rose from 43.6 % to 65.5 %, yet the score fell: the long hard items that used to fail at once are now answered and priced (so Cost fell), and this pod was in Canada while the v1.1.3 run's was in Sweden, so part of the lower Speed is network distance from our server in Germany. This complete run replaces the earlier row; its old score is kept in the artifact under superseded_rows.

Footnote — Open-Jev 2B (Zefan Cai): The author's pinned LoRA adapter, trained scalar decision head and calibration temperature, served by the author's Open-Jev server with prefix caching off, batch size 1 and 4,096-token limit. Serial requests were measured from Sandy over an SSH tunnel to the H100. Self-host latency receives the standing x2 + 0.15 s adjustment. Cost uses the exact Qwen3.5-9B hosted input tariff for 9B and the same conservative same-family proxy for the unlisted 2B; neither receives an automatic 100. Exact normalized comparison found no JevBench public task state or instruction in the 79,116-row public training projection.

Exact normalized comparison found no JevBench public task state or instruction in the 79,116-row public training projection.

Footnote — OpenDecision (ModernBERT-large zero-shot): A zero-shot NLI classifier behind a TypeSafe-compatible server, not a trained decision model: it scores each option as an entailment hypothesis with ModernBERT-large-zeroshot-v2.0. Its choice path runs several NLI passes over the same state, which the reported token count does not include, so a per-token hosted price would be higher than the estimate here. Pre-registered for our CPU in v1.2.7, run on our GPU because the CPU was far too slow.

Footnote — OpenJev (thinking, BF16): OpenJev's real typed-API thinking switch at think=512, using its own /v1/systemone server over BF16 DiffusionGemma. The thought is generated first, then native probability reads are taken after it. All 534 requests returned valid distributions. Cost counts the server's billed input and thought output tokens.

Footnote — openJev Verdict 1.4: Same public weights as the earlier Verdict row, run through the author's fixed v1.4 engine. That engine auto-loads the calibrator for every option count, frames candidate labels as NLI sentences and uses a 512-token context budget. Run locally on our CPU, serially.

Footnote — openJev Verdict (151M): The openJev-verdict-2.0 Hugging Face repo ships no weights; its config is byte-identical to heman10x/rlcd-modernbert-151m, whose published weights we ran with the author's engine. The 'verdict2-base' checkpoint behind the README's numbers is not downloadable yet (Git LFS 404); we will run it once it is.

Footnote — Qwen3-Reranker-4B: Neutral documented reranker adapter; instruction and no-instruction public calibration were run, then frozen before one held-out pass.

Footnote — reflex-27b (Qwen3.8-27B): The frozen public Qwen3.8-27B checkpoint through reflex at the requested pinned commit, with two option orders averaged and temperature 1. No adapter or fitted calibration file. Run serially on our H100 NVL. Self-host latency receives the standard ×2 + 0.15 s adjustment; cost uses the exact base model's public hosted input tariff.

Footnote — reflex 4B (kshetrajna12): The author's reflex-serve: Qwen3.5-4B with the published LoRA and its per-primitive calibration file; the state is encoded once and each question read from the label logits. Run serially on our GPU; the author discloses that the 231 public items were used four times as a development gate.

Footnote — SimpleJev Qwen3.6-35B-A3B: Author's no-login shared demo, model id recorded verbatim, one request at a time at or below its 2 RPS limit. SimpleJev reads answer-token logits and returns the complete distribution; it does not generate an answer. Speed uses the public-demo x2 load adjustment; cost uses a hosted size-class input price and is not free/100.

Footnote — smalljev semantic-v9: The public semantic-v9 LoRA and native heads over MiniCPM5-2B-Base, through the mapping frozen before the run. It has a typed Python contract but no TypeSafe-compatible HTTP route. The released training recipe explicitly hill-climbed against JevBench's public shape and source families; this allowed public benchmark-directed development is disclosed. Cost is $0.04/M measured input tokens, not free/100.

Footnote — Winnow-12B Q8: The submitted Q8_0 GGUF ran through the pinned author's TypeSafe-compatible /v1/systemone server with 8,192 context, four resident decision branches, Q8 KV, and full GPU offload. The private training corpus was not released. The author's checksum-based audit reports zero exact public-item overlap, but that claim cannot be independently reproduced; our scan found no exact public state or instruction text in the released artifacts. Cost uses the $0.05/M-input hosted Gemma 3 12B reference, not free/100.

Footnote — ZeroEntropy zerank-2: Neutral documented reranker adapter; instruction and no-instruction public calibration were run, then frozen before one held-out pass.

Footnote — open-alternative-jev: With the options in reverse order (A. no, B. yes) the same model scored 21 % instead of 72 % on yes/no answer-judging items — small models are very sensitive to option order. The ranked row uses the author's own order
(`A. yes, B. no`, as his `yes_no()` helper builds it); the reversed-order run was our adapter's mistake and is kept only as raw
files (`results/v1.2/wip/`, GPU round runs).

## How the score works

| Axis | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Intelligence** | Per tier: 100 x (accuracy - chance) / (1 - chance), clipped at 0. Chance is 1 / options for each item (1 / levels for score items), then averaged within the tier. Tier weights: hard 30 %, easy 14 %, standard 28 %, judge 28 %. Failed, timed-out or unparseable answers count as wrong. |
| **Calibration** | Hard tier only, systems that return a probability distribution: mean of (a) 100 x (1 - ECE/0.5), ECE = top-label expected calibration error in 10 bins, and (b) probability fidelity = 100 x (1 - mean total-variation distance) between the returned distribution and the exact gold distribution on the 20 probability items. Label-only systems have none; it counts as 0 in the JevBench Score. |
| **Speed** | Mean of score(p50) and score(p95) of the serial 242-decision standard+judge run; score(s) = 100 - 20 log10(s / 0.1 s), clipped to 0..100 (0.1 s = 100, 1 s = 80, 10 s = 60). Latency of self-hosted and demo endpoints is adjusted ×2 (+0.15 s on our own servers) to approximate production load — an assumption, not a measurement; raw measurements are in the table and the repo. Production APIs (Jev, djev, classifier.dev, OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek, Chutes) are not adjusted. |
| **Cost** | US dollars per 1,000 DECISIONS — not per 1,000 tokens. One decision is one whole question: its state, its rubric and its options, which is hundreds to thousands of input tokens. Pooled over all 534 v1.2 decisions; score = 100 - 30 log10(usd / 0.001), clipped to 0..100 ($0.001 = 100, $0.01 = 70, $0.10 = 40, $1 = 10). Measured = public tariff x measured tokens. est. = hosted-provider list price of the same weights or size class x tokens (for a flat-rate service, its published plan price at full use). announced = the provider's published price, not yet charged (free preview), x measured tokens. |
| **JevBench Score** | Geometric mean of Intelligence, Calibration, Speed and Cost, 25 % each. If chance-corrected Intelligence is below 50, multiply by (Intelligence / 50)^2; at or above 50 there is no penalty. |

## Other views (not the JevBench Score)

Other views reweight the same four axes and combine them the same way (geometric mean). They are not the JevBench Score. Weights are Intelligence : Calibration : Speed : Cost.

220 new decisions (111 public, 109 held out): long multi-condition policy documents (2-6k tokens), priority trade-offs, deliberately ambiguous cases with a 'no clear answer' label, traps, multi-hop lookups, date/number reasoning, adversarial distractors, subtle answer-judging, overlapping routing, and probability items with an exact gold distribution. Half written by Claude Opus 5, half by GPT-5.6 Sol; each item reviewed blind and then against its gold by the other model; one discussion round; frozen and hashed before any benchmarked system saw an item. No item was selected on any system's answers.

## Cost basis

**The Cost column is US dollars per 1,000 DECISIONS, not per 1,000 tokens.** One decision is a whole question: its state,
its rubric and its options — hundreds to thousands of input tokens. One decision is a whole question, not a token. Jev 1.13.0 reads 950 input tokens per decision on average over the 534 v1.2 decisions. At its public tariff of $0.042 per MILLION input tokens (output tokens are free, https://docs.typesafe.ai/models), 1,000 decisions therefore cost 950 x 1,000 x $0.042 / 1,000,000 = $0.0399. That is what the Cost column shows: $0.0399 per 1,000 decisions, not per 1,000 tokens.

## Accuracy by subject topic

Accuracy per subject topic over all four tiers (easy, standard, judge, hard): correct / attempted; failures count as wrong; items a partial run never attempted are left out. Aggregates only; not part of the JevBench Score. Topics differ in their tier mix (n_items_by_tier), so compare systems within a topic, not topics with each other. A topic with fewer than 15 attempted items for a system is too thin to read (partial runs). How the topics were assigned: [`datasets/TOPICS.md`](datasets/TOPICS.md).

## Limitations

- **The latency adjustment (×2, +0.15 s) is an assumption, not a measurement.** We ran self-hosted and demo endpoints one request at a time (parallelism 1, no other load), so their latency is likely better than the same model on a busy production server; the official Jev API presumably runs under high load, given the public interest. Serving under load trades per-user speed for throughput: in the NVIDIA chart shown by [SemiAnalysis](https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/nvidia-blackwell-perf-tco-analysis), moving to the throughput-maximising setting cuts per-user tokens/s by far more than 2×. That chart is a 1.8T MoE on GPU clusters, not a 4B model on one GPU, so it supports the direction and size of the effect, not our exact factor. The +0.15 s stands for infrastructure our self-hosted tests lacked: authentication, load balancing, logging, billing, API gateway. Raw p50/p95 are in the tier table above and in the artifact; a measurement under load is planned.
- 534 decisions is a pilot, not a census, and it is English-only. Held-out decisions are sent to the evaluated services to get predictions: not public is not the same as not seen.
- Latency is one origin (a server in Germany) at one time of day; production APIs, public demos, our GPU and a local CPU are different kinds of latency.
- Estimated costs describe what a large inference provider would charge for a model of that size, not what the author pays.

## Revision log

- **v1.3.0** (2026-09-22): Scoring-only release; the task set and measurements are unchanged. Intelligence is now accuracy above each item's uniform-guessing baseline, aggregated with the existing tier weights. If chance-corrected Intelligence is below 50, the composite receives a growing (Intelligence / 50)^2 penalty. Calibration, Speed, Cost and ranking eligibility are unchanged.
- **v1.2.16** (2026-09-21): Added the reranker class and five Apache-2.0 open rerankers. A neutral adapter, identical task instructions, public-only temperature/yes-no calibration grids, and a no-instruction public baseline were preregistered before the held-out run. Every row covers all 534 frozen decisions; no earlier row or task changed.
- **v1.2.15** (2026-09-21): Added Open-Jev 2B and Open-Jev 9B by Zefan Cai. Both public checkpoints ran all 534 frozen decisions through the author's pinned LoRA-plus-decision-head server, serially on our RunPod H100 with prefix caching off. An exact normalized-text audit found no JevBench public state or instruction in the 79,116-row public training projection. No earlier measurement or task changed.
- **v1.2.14** (2026-09-21): Added Winnow-12B Q8 after its author requested evaluation. The pinned Q8_0 GGUF ran all 534 unchanged decisions through the author's pinned TypeSafe-compatible server, serially on our lium.io RTX 4090. The row records the applicable Apache-2.0 Gemma 4 terms, non-zero hosted-reference cost and the independently unverifiable private-training overlap claim. No earlier measurement or task changed.
- **v1.2.13** (2026-09-21): Added OpenJev (thinking, BF16) using OpenJev's native typed-API think=512 switch over DiffusionGemma. It ran all 534 unchanged decisions serially on the same H200. No earlier measurement or task changed.
- **v1.2.12** (2026-09-21): Added djev (thinking), an experimental full-generation run over the same open DiffusionGemma checkpoint used by djev-dev. Thinking was enabled with a frozen 8,192-token output cap on all 534 unchanged decisions. Current djev-dev itself hard-codes thinking off, one denoising step and read-only inference, so this row is not presented as a switch in its published typed API. No earlier measurement or task changed.
- **v1.2.10** (2026-09-21): Added smalljev semantic-v9 after its author requested evaluation. The public Apache-2.0 MiniCPM5-2B-Base LoRA and native decision heads ran all 534 frozen decisions serially on our lium.io A6000. Its mapping, endpoint condition, non-zero hosted-reference cost basis and public-benchmark-directed training disclosure were committed before the run (docs/v1.2-additions-smalljev.md). No earlier measurement or task changed.
- **v1.2.9** (2026-09-21): Added Certo v1 (AltSlate Labs) after its author requested evaluation. The public MIT ModernBERT-large checkpoint ran all 534 frozen decisions through the author's DecisionModel, serially on our RunPod RTX 3090. Its mapping, published 64-token state and 48-token option limits, endpoint condition and hosted-price cost basis were pushed before the run (docs/v1.2-additions-certo.md). No earlier measurement or task changed.
- **v1.2.8** (2026-09-21): Added requested systems on the unchanged frozen 534-decision set, each through its author's own server and the existing TypeSafe adapter, one request at a time: decider-35b-a3b and reflex-27b (issues #4, #5), decider-2b (#2), reflex 4B (#3), OpenDecision, jev-local and LitJev on our RunPod GPUs; GLiNER2 large on our CPU; and decision-machine-1 (#8), a closed decision model behind milliseconds.ai's production API, shown in its own class. jqv (#6, #9) was re-run in full on our own GPU from its now-public serving code; that complete run replaces the v1.2.7 partial row. Bespoke Nimble 9B was re-run at Bespoke Labs' request after they raised its serving prompt limit from 2,048 to 8,192 tokens; the complete re-run replaces the v1.1.3 row (its old score is kept under superseded_rows). Mappings, endpoint conditions and cost bases were pushed before the runs (docs/v1.2-additions-run4.md, docs/v1.2-additions-run4b.md). No earlier measurement changed.
- **v1.2.7** (2026-09-20): Added three systems: jqv (a stock Qwen3-32B read as a decision model, submitted with a public endpoint) and the GLiNER2.5 small and multi checkpoints. The GLiNER2.5 rows ran the full frozen 534-decision set on our CPU with the same mapping as the GLiNER2 row. jqv is a partial row: its endpoint is the submitter's own machine, and this revision stopped sending held-out items to an endpoint a submitter operates. The easy and standard/judge tiers had already been sent in full when that was decided; the 109 held-out hard items never were, so the row covers 425 of 534 decisions and carries no rank. Mappings, endpoint conditions and cost bases were committed before any row was aggregated and before the published GLiNER2.5 runs started (docs/v1.2-additions-run3.md); jqv's run had begun about ten minutes earlier, but it needs no mapping and is priced at its base model's public tariff. No earlier row changed.
- **v1.2.6** (2026-09-20): Added openJev Verdict 1.4 and the identified SimpleJev public-demo configurations on the unchanged frozen 534-decision set. No earlier row changed.
- **v1.2.5** (2026-09-20): Added kev 0.5B and the 0.6B, 4B and 8B research previews. Each ran the full frozen v1.2 set (534 decisions including held-out items) through kev's native TypeSafe-compatible endpoint on an RTX 3090. No other row changed.
- **v1.2.4** (2026-09-20): classifier.dev (fast tier) leaves the ranking and becomes an honorable mention. It is not its own model: its own pages say "The fast tier is Jev, TypeSafe's decision model" (https://classifier.dev/benchmark), so ranking it against Jev ranks Jev's model against Jev's model at a different price. General rule from this revision on: a service that runs another entrant's model is listed with all of its scores and axes, but is not ranked against the models. Its numbers, axes, cost basis, radars and per-task outcomes are unchanged; only its rank is gone. Every other row moves up one place; no score changed.
- **v1.2.3** (2026-09-20): Cost correction. Every row's $ per 1,000 decisions is recomputed with each of the 534 decisions counted exactly once and priced exactly once. Three arithmetic mistakes were fixed: the 242-decision standard+judge run was averaged twice in the v1.1-tier price (556 rows instead of 314); rows priced from the gemini-3.1-flash-lite token counts used that run's standard+judge-only average (452 input tokens per decision) for all 314 v1.1 decisions instead of its average over all 314 (383); and requests whose answer came back unparseable were left unpriced although they were billed (9 DeepSeek V4.1 Flash decisions). The first two made the affected rows look 1.5-11 % more expensive than they are; the third made DeepSeek look 2.6 % cheaper. No tariff, no measurement, no item and no answer changed, and no rank changed. Details: results/v1.2/cost-correction-v1.2.3.json.
- **v1.2.2** (2026-09-19): Added five systems requested by readers: Laya, jeff, GLiNER2, openJev Verdict and classifier.dev (fast tier). Full v1.2 set each (534 decisions incl. held-out), scored with the unchanged v1.2 rules. Local systems ran on our CPU (4 threads) with the usual self-hosted latency adjustment; classifier.dev is a production API. Mappings were fixed before the runs (docs/v1.2-additions.md). No other row changed.
- **v1.2.1** (2026-09-19): Added djev (Maisa, diffusion-gemma): full v1.2 set (534 decisions incl. held-out) through its production API, scored with the unchanged v1.2 rules. Cost at djev's announced price ($0.035/M input tokens, output free), which is not yet charged (free preview). No other row changed.
- **v1.2** (2026-09-19): Final JevBench Score: 4 axes, geometric mean.

## What changed in the score (v1.3.0)

A system that is cheap and fast but barely better than guessing could rank high; intelligence is now measured above
chance, and systems below half-way get a growing penalty.

- Intelligence is `(accuracy - chance) / (1 - chance)` within each tier, clipped at zero. Chance is computed for every
  frozen item as `1 / number of options` (`1 / levels` for score items), before the unchanged 14:28:28:30 tier weighting.
- If chance-corrected Intelligence is below 50, the composite is multiplied by `(Intelligence / 50)²`. At 50 or above,
  no penalty applies.
- Calibration, Speed, Cost, the task set, measurements and ranking eligibility are unchanged.

## What changed from v1.2-wip to v1.2

- Score: four axes (Intelligence, Calibration, Speed, Cost), 25 % each, geometric mean — replaces the Balanced 33:33:33 arithmetic Main Score.
- Intelligence weights hard 30 % (was 50 %); the rest 1 : 2 : 2 over easy : standard : judge.
- Speed scale 20 points per 10× (was 50); Cost scale 30 points per 10× from $0.001 (was 25). Latency of non-production endpoints adjusted (assumption, see the speed note).
- One open-alternative-jev row (author's option order), named plainly; the reversed-order run is a footnote.
- Needle 3 options-as-tools priced on Needle 3's per-token basis ($0.0162 est.; it had no price).
- Qwen3.8 27B on Chutes is treated as a production API (no latency adjustment).

## Cost correction in v1.2.3 (20 September 2026)

Every price on this page was recomputed so that each of the 534 decisions is counted exactly once, and priced exactly
once. No tariff, no measurement, no item, no answer and no rank changed. What was wrong:

1. The v1.1 and v1.1.3 aggregations built their cost average from a row list that contained the 242-decision standard+judge run twice (once as the standard tier, once as the judge tier) and the 72 easy decisions once: 556 rows instead of 314. The standard and judge tiers were therefore over-weighted in the price, which made the affected rows look 1.5-3.3 % more expensive than they are.
2. Rows without their own token counts were priced at the input tokens of the gemini-3.1-flash-lite run measured on the 242 standard+judge decisions only (452 per decision) and that figure was applied to all 314 v1.1 decisions, which excludes the shorter easy tier. Over all 314 decisions the same run averages 383.41 input tokens, which is the figure used from v1.2.3 on. This made the affected rows look 4-11 % more expensive.
3. A metered row's price left out the requests whose answer came back unparseable. Those requests returned HTTP 200 with generated tokens and were billed, and JevBench already counts them as wrong answers, so from v1.2.3 they are priced too. Only DeepSeek V4.1 Flash had any (9 of its 314 v1.1 decisions); its price rises by 2.6 %.
4. No tariff was wrong. The hard-tier costs, and classifier.dev's flat plan price, were already correct.

Almost every affected row had been published as slightly **more** expensive than it is: those prices move down by 1.5 %
to 11 % and their JevBench Scores up by at most 0.2 points. DeepSeek V4.1 Flash moves the other way (+2.6 %, score
58.1 → 57.8) because its unparseable-but-billed requests are now priced. No rank changed. Row-by-row figures and
